# TCP Chat Server

**Author**: Chris L Chapman and Brandon Haynes
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
We will be building a TCP-based chatroom using Python's low-level socket interface. Clients should be able to connect using a telnet or netcat client and communicate with each other. Clients should also be able to run special commands to quit, list users, reset their nickname, and send direct messages. You may add as many featrues to the chat as you would like.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. This is also an area which you can include any visuals; flow charts, example usage gifs, screen captures, etc.-->

## API
<!-- Provide detailed instructions for your applications usage. This should include any methods or endpoints available to the user/client/developer. Each section should be formatted to provide clear syntax for usage, example calls including input data requirements and options, and example responses or return values. -->

## Change Log
